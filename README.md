## Basic Flow

                                0, 4, 8, 12, 4, 8, 12, 4, 8
Periodic nomad job set to a cron for 7am, 11pm, 3pm, 7pm, 11pm, 3am

npm install rss-to-json
```

<!-- target: rss -->
```bash
node ./script.js | jq -r '.items[4].title + " - " + .items[4].description + " - " +.items[4].link'
```
